# Triangular-Numbers
Looks at the pattern of triangular numbers appearing in between subsequent squares of natural numbers.
The sequence of numbers of triangular numbers appearing in between natural squares seem to follow a recurisve pattern
that describes the pattern itself in a sequence of 21's and 2121's or 22's or 11's. This property is might be related to the way
squares are calculated : a triangle is just half of a square.
